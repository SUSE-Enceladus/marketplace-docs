## Prerequisites

1. These instructions assume you have subscribed to the SUSE Cloud Observability agent for EKS offer in AWS Marketplace, have met AWS' [prerequisites for deploying applications with Helm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/helm.html), and have met the [SUSE Observability prerequisites](https://docs.stackstate.com/get-started/k8s-quick-start-guide#prerequisites-for-amazon-eks).
2. You must have access to, or operate a SUSE Cloud Observability service. See https://more.suse.com/SUSE_Cloud_Observability_Early_Access_Program.html to get started.

## Required values

In order to connect the agent to your SUSE Cloud Observability account, you must provide some values along with the helm chart installation.

### SUSE Observability Web Console

On your SUSE Cloud Observability account, Add a new instance of the Kubernetes StackPack.

Enter the name of your kubernetes cluster, then click *INSTALL*. SUSE Observablity Cloud will update to show "**The SUSE Observability Kubernetes StackPack is waiting for data**".

### Helm Command Line

Install the Cluster Agent StackPack with the following `helm` command:

```sh
helm install \
--set-string 'stackstate.apiKey'='<Api Key>' \
--set-string 'stackstate.cluster.name'='<Cluster Name>' \
--set-string 'stackstate.url'='<StackState Ingest URL>' \
stackstate/stackstate-k8s-agent
```

Be sure to replace the `<Api Key>`, `<Cluster Name>`, and `<StackState Ingest URL>` with the values of the same name, provided in the SUSE Observability web console.

ðŸ’¡ *Additonal values can be configured, as required. See the [helm chart documentation](https://github.com/StackVista/helm-charts/blob/suse-observability/2.3.0/stable/suse-observability-agent/README.md#values) for all available values.*

Shortly, the StackPack will be installed and will immediately begin reporting data to SUSE Observability:

**Congratulations!** You have successfully configured the SUSE Cloud Observabilility Agent via Helm Chart.
